The application has two log files: An access log, which logs the HTTP requests and

Logging is disabled by default.

The application can do a rollover of the log files at a predetermined size
of *\*-size* bytes. It will keep up to *\*-count* backups of older files.
If *\*-size* or *\*-count* are 0 rollover will never occur and the files
will grow indefinitely.

KiBi bytes respectively.
