Introduction
============

PyPackProxy is a caching proxy for Python package indexes (repositories) that
conform to :PEP:`503` (Simple Repository API).

Besides caching files from an external repository PyPackProxy can host customized files for
external projects (e.g. wheels created for projects that provide only source packages) or
private projects (names must be different from projects in the repository).

Web-Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPackProxy provides a simple web-interface. It shows on its startpage a list with
all locally stored projects. The names are links to the project pages
(if not disabled; see :doc:`config`).

In the administration area new project directories can be created or deleted, files can
be uploaded to or deleted from those directories. Admin access can be disabled (see: :doc:`config`).

Running PyPackProxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run PyPackProxy type::

   $ pypackproxy path/to/config.file

PIP configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use PyPackProxy with PIP use the ``--index-url`` command line argument
or set the ``index-url`` option in ``pip.conf``. The url must be the base URL of
PyPackProxy with the path ``/simple`` appended, e.g.
``https://pypp.example.com:8888/simple``.
